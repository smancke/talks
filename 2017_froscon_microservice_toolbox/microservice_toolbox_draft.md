# Microservice Toolbox

## Building blocks for your next microservice platform

Thinking in small and self contained pieces brings wonderful benefits, but also a lot of new problems. In the last three years I had the chance to work on different microservice platforms. The challenges I faced in these platforms were more or less the same.

Over time I identified a number of best practices (not to say 'patterns') and a robust set of software tools to tackle these problems. So, time to share this experience with you. The topics I will cover are: API-Routing with traefik and fabio, service discovery with DNS, UI composition with lib-compose, distributed login management with JWT and loginsrv, data decoupling with kafka, logging conventions and my new swiss army knife: the  caddy webserver. Nevertheless I will say some words about golang and why it's my language of choice for most new microservices.
